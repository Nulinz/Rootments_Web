            <h4 id="h48">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                ('DNT')
                feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognising
                and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                signals
                or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
                standard
                for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
                in
                a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>
